        "description": "Python is a powerful programming language that\u2019s easy to learn and fun to play with. But once you\u2019ve gotten a handle on the basics, what do you do next? Python Playground is a collection of imaginative programming projects that will inspire you to use Python to make art and music, build simulations of real-world phenomena, and interact with hardware like the Arduino and Raspberry Pi. You\u2019ll learn to use common Python tools and libraries like numpy, matplotlib, and pygame to do things like: *Generate Spirograph-like patterns using parametric equations and the turtle module *Create music on your computer by simulating frequency overtones *Translate graphical images into ASCII art *Write an autostereogram program that produces 3D images hidden beneath random patterns *Make realistic animations with OpenGL shaders by exploring particle systems, transparency, and billboarding techniques *Construct 3D visualizations using data from CT and MRI scans *Build a laser show that responds to music by hooking up your computer to an Arduino Programming shouldn\u2019t be a chore. Have some solid, geeky fun with Python Playground. The projects in this book are compatible with both Python 2 and 3.",
